### A note from Affinidi

Affinidi Developer Tools are currently in the open beta phase and we are refining our product every day. The Affinidi Developer Tools may be incomplete and may contain errors – they may be unstable and may cause a loss of functionality and data. Use of the Affinidi Developer Tools will be at your own risk. As our engineers seek to improve our platform, we would not have the resources to provide any maintenance or tech support at this time.

### Is there anything I should not develop?

We only provide the tools - how you use them is largely up to you. We have no control over what you develop with our tools - but please use our tools responsibly!

We hope that you would not develop anything that contravenes any applicable laws or regulations. Your projects should also not infringe on Affinidi’s or any third party’s intellectual property (for instance, misusing other parties’ data, code, logos, etc).

### What responsibilities do I have to my end-users?

Please ensure that you have in place your own terms and conditions, privacy policies, and other safeguards to ensure that the projects you build are secure for your end users.

If you are processing personal data, please protect the privacy and other legal rights of your end-users and store their personal or sensitive information securely.

Some of our components would also require you to incorporate our end-user notices into your terms and conditions.
