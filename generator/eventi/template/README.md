# Event Management with Affinidi Trust Network

In this workshop, you'll build [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) application bootstrapped with [Affinidi CLI](https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-cli/generate-app/) using the Affinidi Trust Network (ATN) that feature passwordless authentication flows, verifiable credential issuance, and consent-driven data access powered by the Iota framework. You'll also implement open standards-based workflows for collecting, storing, and sharing data securely, creating privacy-centric digital identity solutions.

## What you will build?

The workshop is structured into different key modules

- [**Module 1: Generating Event Management Application from Affinidi CLI With Affinidi Login**](/docs/generate-app.md): Use the [Affinidi CLI](https://docs.affinidi.com/dev-tools/affinidi-cli/generate-app/) (generate app command) to kickstart your journey with Affinidi Trust Network by generating reference codes for different use-cases using different programming languages, frameworks, and IAM solutions.

  Learn to create secure and user-friendly authentication flows without relying on traditional passwords using [Affinidi Login](https://docs.affinidi.com/docs/affinidi-login/how-affinidi-login-works/)

- Estimated time to complete the module: **5 min**

- [**Module 2: Issue Event Ticket as Verifiable Credential**](/docs/credentials-issuance.md) Dive into the Credentials Issuance feature to issue tamper-evident digital credentials, enabling trust in digital interactions through the flow of portable trusted data using [Affinidi Credential Issuance Service](/docs/credentials-issuance.md)

  - Estimated time to complete the module: **10 min**

- [**Module 3: Building Consent-Driven Data Access for Verification**](/docs/iota-framework-verification.md): Implement workflows that ensure users have full control over their data, with emphasis on secure and transparent data sharing practices using [Affinidi Iota Framework](/docs/iota-framework-recommendation.md)

  - Estimated time to complete the module: **10 min**

- [**Module 4: (Optional) Building Consent-Driven Data Access for Recommendation**](/docs/iota-framework-recommendation.md): Implement workflows that ensure users have full control over their data, with emphasis on secure and transparent data sharing practices using [Affinidi Iota Framework](/docs/iota-framework-verification.md)
  - Estimated time to complete the module: **10 min**

By the end of these modules, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of how to leverage the Affinidi Trust Network (ATN) to build robust, user-centric interoperable applications.
