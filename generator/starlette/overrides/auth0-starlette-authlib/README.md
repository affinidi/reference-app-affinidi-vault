# Auth0 affinidi login demo with Starlette

This is a template that showcases how to use Auth0 with Affinidi Vault to perform authentication and to interact with the vault. It accomplishes this through Affinidi Vault Chrome Extension using the [OpenID for Verifiable Presentations specification.](https://openid.net/specs/openid-4-verifiable-presentations-1_0.html)

First, copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```
cp .env.example .env
```

## Install

Install the required dependencies:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Create Login Configuration and update .env

Create your **Affinidi Login Configuration** with the [Affinidi CLI](https://github.com/affinidi/affinidi-cli#set-up-affinidi-login-for-your-applications) or at [Affinidi Portal](https://portal.affinidi.com/), make sure to add `https://{tenant-name}.us.auth0.com/login/callback` into authorized redirect URIs.

After confirming the details, another popup shows the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and **Issuer** for your Login Configuration. Copy the generated Client Credentials and use them to integrate with Affinidi Login.

**Warning**: the **client secret** is only shown once, so make sure to copy it to a safe place.

## Setup Auth0 tenant & application

Visit [Auth0](https://auth0.com/) to create a new account or login to existing one.

```ini
PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=""
PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET=""
PROVIDER_ISSUER=""
```

> Note: Add `https://` protocol to the domain.

5. Scroll down and set:

- **Allowed Callback URLs** to `http://localhost:8301/auth`
- **Allowed Logout URLs** to `http://localhost:8301`

  );

  const profile = {
    user_id: idToken.sub,
    email: idToken.custom.find((c) => c.email).email,
