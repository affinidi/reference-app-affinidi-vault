# Introduction

This is a reference app generated by Affinidi CLI tool with Java and Springboot framework



## Prerequisite 

1. Make sure you have [JAVA 21](https://jdk.java.net/21/) installed on your machine. Run the following command in a terminal session to check the java version

```sh 
   java --version 
```
You should get an output as below. If not, please reinstall java21 using the link above
```sh
openjdk 21.0.2 2024-01-16
```
2. Ensure that your JAVA_HOME environment variable is set to the installation directory
```sh
export JAVA_HOME="/usr/local/opt/openjdk"
```
3. Optionally you can add this entry to your respective profile (~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc)


## Getting Started

Setting up the reference app is easy, just follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies
```sh
sh mvnw clean
sh mvnw install
```

2. Create Login Configuration

To integrate Affinidi Login into your application and offer a passwordless login experience, you need to create a Login Configuration.
Follow [login config setup guide](./README-LOGINCONFIG.md) to create a login configuration for this application.

For current java-springboot application use `http://localhost:8080/login/oauth2/code/javademo` as redirect-uri.

3. Update application environment variables 

Create an application.properties for your project to hold environment variables

```sh
cd src/main/resources
cp application.properties.example application.properties
```

Update the ClientId, ClientSecret and Issuer received from creating the login configuration into the application.properties.
* Do not enclose these values with '' while updating. As an example, this is how your application.properties should look like

```
issuerUri=https://084036a6-a775-478a-9a97-a1323738897f.apse1.login.affinidi.io
clientId=78f3b3c1-d130-42fe-b692-6fba29827686
clientSecret=7q6Xh1uSltz.fZjgMmvtIFiMpT
```

`clientId:` Client ID generated during create login configuration

`clientSecret:` Client Secret generated during create login configuration

`issuer:` Issuer Url from Login configuration 

## Build and run the project:

```sh
sh mvnw spring-boot:run
```
Then visit: http://localhost:8080/ to browse the reference app
